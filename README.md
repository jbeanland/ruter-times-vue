# Ruter Timing App V2.0

Once upon a time the application I'd been using to tell me when a train should arrive mysteriously stopped working. Since I was a bit meh on it anyway I decided to build my own, leading to [this project](https://github.com/jbeanland/ruter-times).

Eventually I decided I should rebuild the (kinda spaghetti) JQuery implementation with something all in Vue and update the look and functionality while I was at it. Thus, this version was born.

The original used a Python-Flask backend to get and format data from the [Ruter API](https://reisapi.ruter.no/help) whereas with this version everything is handled on the frontend.

Styling from [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), [Buefy](https://buefy.github.io/) and [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).


Currently hosted [on Heroku](https://ruter-times.herokuapp.com/).
